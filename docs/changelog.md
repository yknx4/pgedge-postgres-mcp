# Changelog

All notable changes to the pgEdge Natural Language Agent will be
documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Each built-in tool, resource, and prompt can now be enabled or
  disabled via an environment variable in addition to the
  `builtins` section of the configuration file. The variables are
  `PGEDGE_BUILTIN_TOOL_*`, `PGEDGE_BUILTIN_RESOURCE_*`, and
  `PGEDGE_BUILTIN_PROMPT_*`; see the configuration reference for
  the complete list. This is useful in containerized deployments
  where editing the configuration file is awkward. (#139)

### Changed

- The LLM provider clients (Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama) now use the
  shared
  [`pgedge-go-llm-lib`](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-go-llm-lib)
  library instead of hand-rolled HTTP wire code; approximately 1500
  lines of provider-specific code are removed from `internal/chat/`.
  Behaviour is preserved; the `LLMClient` interface is unchanged.

- Anthropic prompt caching now covers both the tools block and the
  system prompt (the library exposes a `WithSystemCaching` builder
  alongside `WithToolCaching`). Long system prompts no longer pay
  full input-token cost on every turn.

- OpenAI models that require the Responses API (`gpt-5-*`, `o1-*`,
  `o3-*`) are now supported transparently; the library routes them
  to `/v1/responses` automatically based on the model name.

- Refactored `Client.LoadMetadataFor` in
  `internal/database/connection.go`. The CTE-based metadata query
  now lives in `internal/database/load_metadata.sql` and is loaded
  via `//go:embed`; the per-row scan and the grouping/transform
  logic are split into `scanMetadataRow` and `buildTableInfo` in
  `internal/database/metadata.go`. `buildTableInfo` is pure and is
  covered by table-driven unit tests that do not require a live
  database. No behavior change. (#153)

- The built-in `pg://system_info` resource now uses the machine-safe
  name `postgresql_system_info` (previously
  `"PostgreSQL System Information"`). The new name matches the
  identifier pattern enforced by Anthropic's tool-name validation
  (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}$`), so the resource no longer breaks
  interoperability when a downstream MCP client forwards built-in
  capability names as provider tool names. The resource URI is
  unchanged. (#139)

- The KB Builder (formerly `cmd/kb-builder` and the
  `internal/kb*` packages) has moved to a standalone project at
  [`pgedge-ai-kb`](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-ai-kb). The
  binary is renamed from `pgedge-nla-kb-builder` to
  `pgedge-ai-kb-builder`. The MCP server itself is unaffected; it
  continues to consume a pre-built `kb.db` at runtime. The Docker
  build now downloads `kb.db` from
  `https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-ai-kb/releases/download/kb-latest/kb.db`
  by default; pass `KB_SOURCE` to override. The
  `pgedge-nla-kb-builder_*` release archives are no longer published
  from this repository.

### Fixed

- Metadata loader now tolerates tables with zero columns
  (e.g. `CREATE TABLE foo()`). The query LEFT JOINs against the
  per-column catalog, so a zero-column table produced a row whose
  `column_name`, `data_type`, and `is_nullable` were all NULL; the
  scan declared those targets as plain `string` and aborted with
  `cannot scan NULL into *string`, failing the entire metadata load
  and surfacing as the misleading `no database connection
  configured for this token` error. The three columns are now
  scanned as `sql.NullString` and zero-column tables appear in the
  metadata with an empty `Columns` slice. (#126)
- HTTP transport now returns `202 Accepted` with an empty body for
  JSON-RPC notifications, per JSON-RPC 2.0 §4.1 and the MCP streamable
  HTTP transport spec. Previously, the server replied to notifications
  with a `200 OK` response that had no `id` field, which is itself not
  a valid JSON-RPC message and caused strict clients (such as the .NET
  MCP SDK) to throw on every notification. Unknown notification methods
  are now also acknowledged silently rather than receiving a `-32601`
  error reply. (#142)

- Stdio transport now correctly distinguishes JSON-RPC notifications
  (no `id` member) from requests with an explicit `"id": null` (per
  JSON-RPC 2.0 §4.1). A request with `"id": null` targeting an unknown
  method previously matched the same `req.ID == nil` guard used to
  suppress notification replies and was silently dropped; it now
  receives the required `-32601 Method not found` response. The
  hardcoded `notifications/initialized` case was likewise affected and
  is now filtered uniformly with all other notifications at the read
  loop, using the same `hasIDField` raw-bytes probe introduced for the
  HTTP transport in #142. (#152)

- JSON-RPC response now always serializes the `id` field, including
  when it is null. Per JSON-RPC 2.0 §5.1, the response object MUST
  include the id member; the value is the originating request's id, or
  null when the id cannot be determined (parse error / invalid
  request) or when the request itself used `"id": null`. The
  `JSONRPCResponse.ID` JSON tag previously used `omitempty`, which
  caused Go's encoder to drop the field for nil interface values —
  producing a response without an `id` field, which is itself a
  malformed JSON-RPC body. This affects both the HTTP and stdio
  transports. (#152)

- Database switching via `select_database_connection` now persists
  correctly in HTTP mode for unbound API tokens.
  `GetAccessibleDatabases` previously returned only the first
  configured database for unbound tokens, causing `getClient` to
  silently override the user's selection on every subsequent tool
  call. The method now returns all databases, matching the behavior
  of `CanAccessDatabase`. (#117)

- Added a JSON-RPC `ping` handler on both stdio and HTTP transports
  so MCP clients that issue `ping` during initialization or health
  checks receive a compliant `{}` result instead of a
  `-32601 Method not found` error. The stdio handler suppresses
  responses to notification-style pings (no `id`) per JSON-RPC
  2.0 §4.1. (#167)

### Added

- The installer detects running Postgres instances and offers
  to connect to them, with automatic database listing.

- Added `--detect` / `-Detect` flag for non-interactive
  auto-connection to detected Postgres instances.

- The installer detects previous installations and offers
  to update the binary or reconfigure the database connection
  instead of re-running the full install flow.

- Schema metadata cache now refreshes automatically based on a
  configurable TTL. The `metadata_ttl` database option controls
  how long cached metadata remains valid (default: 5 minutes).
  This fixes an issue where `get_schema_info` returned stale
  results when tables were created outside the MCP server or
  when using read-only database connections.

- HTTP authentication is now configurable in Docker deployments
  via the `PGEDGE_AUTH_ENABLED` environment variable. Auth remains
  enabled by default; set `PGEDGE_AUTH_ENABLED=false` only in
  trusted local development environments (for example, when
  connecting Claude through `mcp-remote` with a fixed bearer
  token and needing access to multiple databases). The setting is
  honored by both the single-database and multi-database
  initialization paths. (#167)
### Fixed

- Fixed port detection on Windows; the installer now reliably
  detects Postgres instances on all network addresses.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- Docker container now defaults to stdio mode instead of HTTP
  mode. HTTP mode requires setting `PGEDGE_HTTP_ENABLED=true`.
  This allows the Docker image to work with stdio-based MCP
  clients such as the Docker Desktop MCP Toolkit, Claude Code,
  and Claude Desktop.

- Docker init script output now goes to `stderr` instead of
  `stdout`; this keeps `stdout` clean for the MCP protocol in
  stdio mode.

- User and token initialization (`INIT_USERS`, `INIT_TOKENS`)
  now only runs when HTTP mode is enabled. Stdio mode does not
  use HTTP authentication.

- Quickstart demo files (`docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`,
  `pgedge-ait-demo.sh`) are now served from the GitHub
  repository instead of `downloads.pgedge.com`. The Northwind
  example database download is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Queries with trailing semicolons no longer produce a SQL syntax
  error when the server auto-appends a `LIMIT` clause. The server
  now strips trailing semicolons before appending `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`.

- MCP tools (`query_database`, `count_rows`, `get_schema_info`) now
  load metadata synchronously on the first call instead of returning
  a "database is still initializing" error. This eliminates the
  unnecessary LLM retry that previously occurred on every first
  tool call.

- Database connection timeout now defaults to 10 seconds instead of
  blocking for 60+ seconds when a target host is unreachable. A new
  `connect_timeout` configuration option allows customization of
  the timeout duration.

### Security

- The server now rejects queries that reference the
  `transaction_read_only` or `default_transaction_read_only`
  settings when the database connection is in read-only mode.
  This prevents single-statement bypass attacks (such as
  PL/pgSQL `DO` blocks with `set_config()`) that could
  circumvent the `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY` guardrail.

- The system prompt sent to all LLM providers (Anthropic,
  OpenAI, Ollama) now includes explicit safety instructions
  that forbid attempts to bypass read-only mode when the
  database connection does not allow writes.

### Added

- MCP tool selection guidance for AI agents. The server now sends
  a server-level `instructions` field during the MCP initialize
  handshake, directing agents to prefer MCP tools over `psql` and
  shell commands. Tool descriptions include explicit "use this
  instead of..." language to steer tool selection. A new
  documentation page covers recommended `CLAUDE.md` and
  `.cursorrules` configuration for reinforcing tool preference.

- Cursor IDE plugin manifest and setup guide.

- OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification and interactive API browser. The
  server now provides a programmatic OpenAPI specification covering
  all REST endpoints. The specification is available at the
  `/api/openapi.json` endpoint (no authentication required),
  through the `-openapi` CLI flag, and as a static file in the
  documentation. Use `make openapi` to regenerate the static
  copy. The MkDocs site includes a ReDoc-powered interactive API
  browser under For Developers. API responses include an RFC 8631
  `Link` header for automatic discovery by tools such as
  `restish`.

- Write query confirmation in the CLI and Web UI. When a database
  has write access enabled, the user is prompted to confirm DDL and
  DML queries before the server executes the queries. Declining a
  query returns an error to the LLM without executing the query.

- MCP tool annotations on the `query_database` tool. The server
  sets `destructiveHint` and `readOnlyHint` annotations per the
  MCP 2025-03-26 specification; third-party MCP clients that
  support annotations can use the annotations to prompt for user
  confirmation.

- Partitioned table support in `get_schema_info`. The tool now
  recognizes partitioned parent tables (shown as `PARTITIONED TABLE`)
  and hides child partitions by default. Use the new
  `include_partitions` parameter to reveal child partitions when
  needed. This reduces context window usage for databases with
  daily or other time-based partitioning schemes.

- Example DBA toolkit as a drop-in YAML custom definitions file
  (`examples/pgedge-postgres-mcp-dba.yaml`). The toolkit provides
  three pl-do tools: `get_top_queries` for top resource-consuming
  query analysis, `analyze_db_health` for seven-category database
  health checks, and `recommend_indexes` for two-tier index
  recommendations with optional HypoPG simulation.

- Multi-host database connection support for high availability
  and failover. The `hosts` array replaces the single `host` and
  `port` fields when connecting to multiple PostgreSQL servers.
  The server generates a libpq-compatible multi-host connection
  string and passes the list to pgx for automatic failover.

- The `target_session_attrs` option controls read-write routing
  for multi-host connections. Accepted values include
  `any`, `read-write`, `read-only`, `primary`, `standby`, and
  `prefer-standby`.

- Pool health check and connection lifetime settings for
  database connections. The `pool_health_check_period` option
  sets the interval for background health checks; the
  `pool_max_conn_lifetime` option sets the maximum age of a
  pooled connection before the server closes the connection.

- The `PGEDGE_DB_HOSTS` environment variable configures
  multi-host connections as a comma-separated list of
  `host:port` pairs.

- The `--db-hosts` CLI flag specifies multiple database hosts
  as a comma-separated `host:port` list. The
  `--db-target-session-attrs` flag sets the session routing
  attribute for multi-host connections.

- Configuration validation rejects entries that specify both
  the single-host `host` field and the multi-host `hosts`
  array. The validator also checks that `target_session_attrs`
  contains a recognized value.

- The web client displays multi-host connection details in the
  database selector, showing each configured host and port
  alongside the connection status.

- GitHub Codespaces demo environment for one-click evaluation of
  the MCP server in a browser-based development environment.

- One-command installers for Claude Code and Claude Desktop that
  automate binary download, configuration generation, and client
  registration.

- `--max-retries` flag for the kb-builder controls how many times
  transient embedding API errors are retried. The default is 5;
  set to 0 for unlimited retries. Backoff is capped at 60 seconds.

- Connection status field (`connected` or `unavailable`) in the
  `list_database_connections` tool response; databases with status
  `unavailable` are connected on demand when selected.

- Trace file logging for deep diagnostics of MCP interactions.
  Enable with `-trace-file <path>`, the `trace_file` configuration
  option, or the `PGEDGE_TRACE_FILE` environment variable. The
  server writes JSONL entries for tool calls, resource reads, prompt
  executions, HTTP requests, LLM interactions, database switches,
  configuration reloads, and session events.

### Internal

- Replaced the CGO SQLite driver with a pure Go driver, enabling
  fully static binaries without a C compiler dependency.

### Improved

- Expanded the configuration reference in `configuration.md` with
  database connection options (`allow_writes`, `allow_llm_switching`,
  `allowed_pl_languages`, pool settings, and access control), LLM
  proxy options, and previously undocumented CLI flags (`-debug`,
  `-db-*`, user management flags). Added missing entries to the
  environment variable reference and example configuration file.

- Comprehensive documentation expansion to improve Context7 benchmark
  coverage across all ten benchmark categories:

    - New `row-level-security.md` guide covering PostgreSQL RLS/CLS
      integration with the MCP server, including per-user database
      connections, session variable patterns, column-level security
      with grants and views, and a multi-tenant worked example.

    - New `distributed-deployment.md` guide covering multi-instance
      deployment with shared filesystem and object storage patterns,
      nginx and AWS ALB load balancer configuration, Docker Compose
      multi-instance example, Kubernetes deployment with ConfigMap
      and init containers, and knowledge base synchronization.

    - New `custom-knowledgebase-tutorial.md` with an end-to-end
      tutorial for building custom knowledge bases from domain
      documentation, including schema documentation patterns,
      business rules glossaries, KB builder configuration, and
      the internal SQLite database schema.

    - New `client-examples.md` with complete Python and JavaScript
      client implementations covering authentication, schema
      retrieval, query execution, database switching, TSV parsing,
      knowledgebase search, token lifecycle management, and error
      handling with automatic retry.

    - New `error-reference.md` documenting all HTTP status codes,
      JSON-RPC error codes, authentication errors, tool-specific
      errors, database access errors, and troubleshooting steps.

    - Expanded `claude_desktop.md` with a getting started guide,
      build instructions, YAML configuration examples, natural
      language query flow explanation, command-line flags reference,
      setup verification checklist, and detailed troubleshooting.

    - Expanded `authentication.md` with a database access control
      section documenting `available_to_users` authorization, a
      per-token database binding section, an authorization model
      summary, and a token lifecycle management section covering
      expiration detection, automatic re-authentication, and best
      practices for programmatic clients.

    - Expanded `api-reference.md` with schema retrieval examples
      including `curl` commands with authentication, TSV response
      parsing in Python and JavaScript, query execution examples
      with comprehensive error handling and retry logic, a query
      error reference table, and result format documentation.

    - Expanded `deploy_docker.md` with a complete consolidated
      `docker-compose.yml`, a full environment variable reference,
      a quick start guide, and Docker health check documentation.

    - Expanded `multiple_db_config.md` with Python and JavaScript
      client integration examples, access denied error handling,
      and a configuration settings reference clarifying the
      relationship between `llm_connection_selection` and
      `allow_llm_switching`.

### Fixed

- The server no longer exits when configured databases are
  unreachable at startup ([#82](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-postgres-mcp/issues/82)).
  In STDIO mode, each database connection is now attempted
  independently; failures are logged as warnings and the server
  starts with whichever databases are reachable. Unreachable
  databases are connected on demand when a tool or the user
  selects them. The `list_database_connections` tool reports
  each database as `connected` or `unavailable`.

- Closed database clients are no longer returned from the client
  manager cache. Previously, background cleanup or database switching
  could close a client while tool registries still held a reference,
  causing intermittent "Connection pool not found" errors. Retrieval
  points now check a closed flag and transparently create a fresh
  client when needed.

- The `default_transaction_read_only` session parameter is now set
  with a `SET` command after connection instead of as a startup
  parameter. Connection poolers such as PgBouncer and HAProxy do
  not support arbitrary startup parameters; the previous approach
  caused connections to fail with an "unsupported startup parameter"
  error.

- Ollama embedding generation no longer retries or fails the entire
  batch when a chunk exceeds the model's context length. The builder
  detects the error immediately, progressively truncates the text at
  word boundaries (75 %, 50 %, 25 %), and skips the chunk with a
  warning if all attempts fail.

- Custom `pl-do` and `pl-func` tools no longer appear in `tools/list`
  when their language is not in `allowed_pl_languages`. Previously the
  language check only happened at execution time; the server now filters
  PL tools at registration time so clients only see tools they can use.

- Fixed PL/Perl custom tools (`pl-func` and `pl-do`) failing with
  "Unable to load JSON.pm into plperl" when using trusted `plperl`.
  Trusted `plperl` cannot load external Perl modules, so the wrapper
  now uses PostgreSQL's `jsonb_each_text()` via SPI to parse arguments
  instead of `JSON.pm`. Untrusted `plperlu` continues to use `JSON.pm`
  as before.

- Fixed Web GUI losing connection when switching between databases. The
  server now returns proper JSON error responses when the database is
  temporarily unavailable during switching, and the client handles these
  transient states gracefully with automatic retry logic instead of showing
  a disconnection error.

- SIGHUP configuration reload now invalidates stale database
  connections. Previously, reloading the configuration did not close
  connections whose parameters had changed, leaving the server with
  outdated connection settings until restart.

- The `-add-user`, `-add-token`, and related user/token management commands
  now respect the `user_file` and `token_file` paths from the server
  configuration file. Previously, these commands used hardcoded default paths
  regardless of the configuration, which could cause users or tokens to be
  added to the wrong file when custom paths were configured. The commands use
  the priority order: CLI flag > config file > default path. When `-user-file`
  or `-token-file` is explicitly provided on the command line, no configuration
  file is required (except for `-add-token` which needs database names from
  the config). This allows Docker containers and scripts to use these commands
  without a configuration file by specifying paths directly.

## [1.0.0-beta3] - 2026-01-21

### Added

#### Custom Tools

- New custom tools feature for defining database operations as callable MCP
  tools via YAML configuration
- Three tool types are supported:
    - `sql`: Execute parameterized SQL queries with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
      placeholders
    - `pl-do`: Execute PL/* DO blocks (anonymous functions) with automatic
      result handling via `set_config`/`current_setting`
    - `pl-func`: Create temporary PL/* functions with proper RETURN types
- Security controls via `allowed_pl_languages` configuration per database to
  restrict which procedural languages can be used
- Language support includes plpgsql, plpython3u, plv8, and plperl with
  automatic code wrapping and `mcp_return()` helper function
- Configurable per-tool timeout support
- Comprehensive validation of tool definitions at startup

#### LLM Database Connection Switching

- New `list_database_connections` tool allows LLMs to discover available
  database connections
- New `select_database_connection` tool allows LLMs to switch between databases
  during a conversation
- New `llm_connection_selection` configuration option to enable/disable the
  feature (disabled by default for security)
- New `allow_llm_switching` per-database option to exclude specific connections
  from LLM switching (defaults to true when feature is enabled)
- Real-time UI updates in web client when LLM switches databases
- CLI notification message when LLM switches databases

#### Prompt Argument Types

- Prompt arguments now support a `type` field with values `string` (default)
  or `boolean`
- Boolean arguments render as toggle switches in the web GUI instead of text
  fields
- Custom prompts in YAML can specify argument types for improved UI rendering

### Fixed

- The conversation history panel is now expanded by default when the web GUI
  loads, improving accessibility to past conversations.

- Fixed Web GUI database switching causing JSON parse error and disconnect loop.
  The `selectDatabase` function in `useDatabases.js` now checks `response.ok`
  before parsing the response as JSON; the auth middleware and database API
  handlers now return consistent JSON error responses instead of plain text.

- Improved login error messages in the web GUI. Authentication failures now
  display user-friendly messages like "Invalid username or password. Please
  try again." instead of technical RPC error codes.

- Standardized default configuration file paths for consistency. All config
  files now use the `postgres-mcp` prefix and search `/etc/pgedge/` first:
    - Config: `postgres-mcp.yaml` (previously `pgedge-postgres-mcp.yaml`)
    - Tokens: `postgres-mcp-tokens.yaml` (previously `pgedge-postgres-mcp-tokens.yaml`)
    - Users: `postgres-mcp-users.yaml` (previously `pgedge-postgres-mcp-users.yaml`)
    - Secret: `postgres-mcp.secret` (previously `pgedge-postgres-mcp.secret`)

- Improved error messages when the MCP server is unavailable. The web GUI now
  displays user-friendly messages for 502/503/504 errors instead of showing
  raw HTML error pages from the proxy.

- Fixed DDL and DML statements silently failing when `allow_writes` is enabled.
  The `query_database` tool now uses `tx.Exec()` for DDL (CREATE, DROP, ALTER,
  TRUNCATE) and DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) statements instead of `tx.Query()`,
  which could cause statements to not execute properly due to pgx's prepared
  statement caching behavior. DML statements with RETURNING clauses continue
  to use `tx.Query()` to capture returned rows.

## [1.0.0-beta2] - 2026-01-13

### Added

#### Write Access Mode

- New `allow_writes` configuration option for database connections
    - Disabled by default (read-only mode) for safety
    - When enabled, allows the LLM to execute DDL (CREATE, DROP, ALTER) and
      DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) statements
    - Automatic schema metadata refresh after DDL operations to keep
      `get_schema_info` results current
- Visual warnings for write-enabled databases:
    - Web client: Prominent amber warning banner when connected to a
      write-enabled database
    - Web client: Warning chip indicator in database selector popover
    - CLI: `[WRITE-ENABLED]` indicator in `/list databases` output
    - CLI: Warning message when switching to a write-enabled database
- Added `allow_writes` field to `pg://system_info` resource output
- Updated `query_database` tool description to dynamically indicate
  write access status

#### Token Management

- New `count_rows` tool for lightweight row counting before querying large
  tables
- Pagination support (`offset` parameter) in `query_database` tool for paging
  through large result sets
- Truncation detection in query results (fetches limit+1 rows to show "more
  data available" indicator)

#### Configuration Templates

- Added example configuration files in `examples/` directory:
    - `pgedge-postgres-mcp-http.yaml.example` - MCP server HTTP mode config
    - `pgedge-postgres-mcp-stdio.yaml.example` - MCP server stdio mode config
    - `pgedge-nla-cli-http.yaml.example` - CLI client HTTP mode config
    - `pgedge-nla-cli-stdio.yaml.example` - CLI client stdio mode config
    - `postgres-mcp-users.yaml.example` - User authentication template
    - `postgres-mcp-tokens.yaml.example` - Token authentication template

#### CLI Features

- Added `-mcp-server-config` command line flag for specifying the MCP server
  config file path in stdio mode

#### CI/CD

- Claude PR review GitHub Action workflow for automated code reviews
- CodeRabbit configuration for additional PR analysis

#### Knowledgebase Builder

- Hybrid chunking algorithm for improved RAG quality:

    - Two-pass algorithm: Pass 1 splits at semantic boundaries, Pass 2 merges
      undersized chunks
    - Structural element preservation: Code blocks, tables, lists, and
      blockquotes are kept intact when possible
    - Full heading hierarchy tracking: Chunks include breadcrumb context
      (e.g., "API Reference > Authentication > OAuth")
    - Smart splitting for oversized elements: Large code blocks split at line
      boundaries, tables at row boundaries, paragraphs at sentence boundaries
    - Chunk metadata now includes `HeadingPath` (full hierarchy) and
      `ElementTypes` (structural element types in chunk)

- Maintains Ollama compatibility with existing size limits (300 words / 3000
  chars)

### Changed

#### CLI Command Consistency

- Simplified LLM command names:
    - `/set llm-provider` → `/set provider`
    - `/set llm-model` → `/set model`
    - `/show llm-provider` → `/show provider`
    - `/show llm-model` → `/show model`
- Moved standalone listing commands under `/list`:
    - `/tools` → `/list tools`
    - `/resources` → `/list resources`
    - `/prompts` → `/list prompts`
- Added `/list providers` command to list available LLM providers
- Reorganized `/help` output into logical sections

#### Token Efficiency

- Query results now returned in TSV format instead of JSON for better token
  efficiency
- Custom SQL resource data returned in TSV format
- `get_schema_info` tool returns results in TSV format with additional relevant
  information and supports more targeted calls
- Removed redundant resource for retrieving schema info

#### Model Selection

- Model family matching when reloading saved conversations (handles
  date-suffixed model names like `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`)
- Web UI now uses family matching for model selection persistence
- CLI now restores database preference on load
- Added debug messages for model loading troubleshooting

#### Documentation

- Comprehensive documentation restructuring for online publication
- Added configuration setup instructions to README Web Client and CLI sections
- Added Quickstart guide
- Updated security documentation
- Added conversations API and database selection API documentation
- Fixed various documentation formatting issues and environment variable
  references

#### Docker

- Renamed `mcp-server` to `postgres-mcp` in Docker configuration (#12)

### Fixed

- CLI preference saving now works correctly
- Fixed test expecting wrong number of resources (1 instead of 2)
- Updated tests to expect 7 tools after count_rows addition
- Various typo fixes in documentation and configuration

## [1.0.0-beta1] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

This release marks the transition from alpha to beta status, indicating the
software is now feature-complete and ready for broader testing.

#### Internal

- Updated Claude Code configuration

## [1.0.0-alpha6] - 2025-12-12

### Added

#### CLI Features

- Added `none` authentication mode for CLI client to connect to servers with
  authentication disabled (`-mcp-auth-mode none`)

#### Knowledgebase

- Release workflow now builds kb.db with embeddings from all three providers
  (OpenAI, Voyage AI, Ollama)

### Changed

#### Naming

- Renamed server binary from `pgedge-postgres-mcp` to `pgedge-nla-svr`

#### Knowledgebase Builder

- Reduced chunk sizes to avoid hitting Ollama model token limits (250 words
