# Configuring and Using Knowledgebase Search

The `search_knowledgebase` tool provides semantic search over pre-built
documentation databases, allowing you to search PostgreSQL
documentation, pgEdge product documentation, and other technical
resources.

Unlike the `similarity_search` tool, which searches your own data in
PostgreSQL, the `search_knowledgebase` tool searches curated
documentation that has been pre-processed and indexed for efficient
semantic retrieval.

Use `search_knowledgebase` when you need information about:

- PostgreSQL features, syntax, and functions.

- pgEdge products and capabilities.

- Other documented technologies included in the knowledgebase.

Use `similarity_search` when you need to search your own data stored
in PostgreSQL tables.

**Best Practices**

* **Start broad**: Begin with general queries, then refine based on
  results.

* **Use filters**: Add project/version filters when you know what
  you're looking for.

* **Check multiple results**: Review several results for comprehensive
  information.

* **Combine with other tools**: Use with `query_database` to apply
  documentation knowledge to actual queries.

!!! Limitations

    - Results are limited to pre-built documentation.

    - The database must be periodically rebuilt to include new
      documentation.

    - The server requires storage space for the knowledgebase
      database file.

    - Search quality depends on embedding provider consistency.


## Obtaining a Knowledgebase Database

The MCP server consumes a pre-built `kb.db` file at runtime. The
`kb.db` is produced by the standalone
[pgEdge AI Knowledgebase Builder
project](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-ai-kb), which lives in its
own repository.

You can obtain a `kb.db` in two ways.

### Option 1: Download a Pre-Built Release

The pgEdge AI Knowledgebase Builder project publishes release
artifacts that bundle a ready-to-use `kb.db`. The
[latest release](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-ai-kb/releases)
includes the standard pgEdge knowledgebase covering PostgreSQL,
pgEdge product documentation, and related tools.

Download the file and place it where the server can read it:

```bash
curl -L -o kb.db \
    https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-ai-kb/releases/download/<tag>/kb.db
```

### Option 2: Build Your Own

Build a custom knowledgebase, including private or internal
documentation, by running the `pgedge-ai-kb-builder` tool. The
[pgEdge AI Knowledgebase Builder
documentation](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-ai-kb#readme)
includes a Quick Start, the configuration file reference, and a guide
to building from custom sources.

The output file is a SQLite database that the MCP server consumes
read-only at runtime.


## Configuring the MCP Server

To enable the knowledgebase, add the following code snippet to your
server configuration:

```yaml
knowledgebase:
    enabled: true
    database_path: "./kb.db"
    embedding_provider: "voyage"  # or "openai", "ollama"
    embedding_model: "voyage-3"

    # API keys (independent from embedding and LLM sections)
    # Option 1: API key file (RECOMMENDED)
    embedding_voyage_api_key_file: "~/.voyage-api-key"
    # embedding_openai_api_key_file: "~/.openai-api-key"

    # Option 2: Environment variables
    # PGEDGE_KB_VOYAGE_API_KEY or VOYAGE_API_KEY
    # PGEDGE_KB_OPENAI_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY

    # Option 3: Direct config (NOT RECOMMENDED)
    # embedding_voyage_api_key: ""
    # embedding_openai_api_key: ""
```

**IMPORTANT:** The knowledgebase embedding configuration is
**completely independent** from the `embedding` and `llm` sections.
This allows you to:

- Use different embedding providers for semantic search vs. the
  `generate_embeddings` tool.

- Use different API keys for knowledgebase search.

- Configure each section separately via environment variables
  (`PGEDGE_KB_*` prefix for knowledgebase).

**Requirements:**

- A pre-built knowledgebase database file (`.db` file).

- An embedding provider configured for knowledgebase search.

- The same embedding provider and model used to build the database.

**See also:**

  Example](../reference/config-examples/server.md) covers the
  complete server configuration with a knowledgebase section.

- The [pgEdge AI Knowledgebase Builder
  project](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-ai-kb) documents how to
  build a `kb.db`.


## Using the Tool

The `search_knowledgebase` tool supports several search patterns to
help you find relevant documentation.

### Basic Search

The simplest way to search is with just a query string.

```
Tool: search_knowledgebase
Args:
  query: "PostgreSQL window functions"
```

### Performing a Filtered Search

You can narrow your search results by filtering on project name or
version.

Search within a specific project:

```
Tool: search_knowledgebase
Args:
  query: "replication setup"
  project_name: "pgEdge"
```

Search a specific version:

```
Tool: search_knowledgebase
Args:
  query: "JSON functions"
  project_name: "PostgreSQL"
  project_version: "17"
```

### Adjusting the Result Count

You can control how many results are returned.

```
Tool: search_knowledgebase
Args:
  query: "authentication methods"
  top_n: 10
```

Default is 5 results, maximum is 20.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | yes | Natural language search query |
| `project_name` | string | no | Filter by project name |
| `project_version` | string | no | Filter by project version |
| `top_n` | integer | no | Number of results (default: 5, max: 20) |

**Output Format**

Results include:

- **Text**: The relevant documentation chunk.

- **Title**: Document title.

- **Section**: Section heading within the document.

- **Project**: Project name and version.

- **Similarity**: Relevance score (0-1, higher is more relevant).

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for knowledgebase
search.

### Example 1: General Query

In the following example, the `search_knowledgebase` tool uses a
general query to find documentation about composite indexes in
PostgreSQL.

```
Query: "How do I create a composite index in PostgreSQL?"

Results:
- PostgreSQL 17 documentation chunk on CREATE INDEX
- Example of composite index syntax
- Performance considerations
```

### Example 2: Version-Specific Query

In the following example, the `search_knowledgebase` tool uses project
and version filters to find documentation specific to PostgreSQL 17.

```
Query: "MERGE statement"
Project: PostgreSQL
Version: 17

Results:
- PostgreSQL 17 MERGE statement documentation
- Syntax and examples
- Comparison with INSERT...ON CONFLICT
```

### Example 3: Product-Specific Query

In the following example, the `search_knowledgebase` tool uses a
project filter to find pgEdge-specific documentation about
multi-master replication.

```
Query: "multi-master replication"
Project: pgEdge

Results:
- pgEdge replication architecture
- Configuration steps
- Conflict resolution
```
